# CS499Project: Cloud Code

CS499 Senior Design Project: Thomas Deeter, Matthew Thompson, Wade Zengel

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

Cloud Code is an online collaborative IDE that offers many features as modern-day text editors, such as
syntax highlighting, bracket completion, and directory navigation. In addition, it offers real-time collaborative features as you would find in Google Docs such as code highlighting, an updating user list, and live updates.

Our project is hosted at https://cloud-code.net

## Compilation / Deployment / Running Instructions
Please refer to the instructions below for more information about running / deploying our application

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build / Deployment

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

In order to deploy to firebase, please run the command `firebase deploy` after the build step above. This requires you to have the Firebase CLI installed. 


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
